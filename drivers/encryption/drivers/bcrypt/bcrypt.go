// Package bcrypt will encrypt passwords using a strong algorithim, bcrypt,
// and is the recommended driver. The setup option passed in can be:
// { Cost: n, Salt: "string"}
// Where cost is how many iterations bcrypt should perform. The higher the
// number the longer it takes to generate and break. The default is 7.
// Salt is an additional string you want to add in make the hash harder
// to guess. If you don't include one, the internal salt will be used.

const const_bcrypt_help_template = `
  The bcrypt function is the default password hash algorithm for BSD and many other systems.
  Besides incorporating a salt to protect against rainbow table attacks, bcrypt is an adaptive
  function: over time, the iteration count can be increased to make it slower, so it remains
  resistant to brute-force search attacks even with increasing computation power.

  Options: There are two options that should be passed by JSON strings. They are:
      "Cost" and "Salt". Cost is the number of iterations you want for the function, making
      it more costly to encrypt (which is a good thing). Salt is an additional bit of
      encryption you want added when it is encrypting the password. The salt should
      be a long, random string of any characters. Do not include quotes.

      The cost defaults to '7' and the salt has a long, random string built in. You must
      not change the salt after you have set it or passwords will never match again.

  Option format: {"Cost" : 7, "Salt": "abcd...........xyz" }
